# Overbooking Flight Strategy

In the competitive landscape of the airline industry, maximizing the utilization of each flight's seating capacity is crucial for optimizing revenue. However, airlines face the challenge of dealing with passenger no-shows, which can lead to flights departing with empty seats, despite high demand. To mitigate this issue and enhance revenue opportunities, airlines often employ an overbooking strategy. This report delves into the analysis of overbooking as a strategic approach for an Airline, aiming to determine the optimal balance between increased revenue from selling more tickets than available seats and the potential costs associated with accommodating passengers when a flight is overbooked.
Overbooking, while financially beneficial, carries inherent risks, primarily the possibility of having more passengers show up for a flight than the aircraft can accommodate. This situation necessitates the bumping of passengers, either to later flights or, in certain cases, upgrading them to higher service classes, if available. These actions, while necessary from an operational standpoint, can lead to passenger dissatisfaction and potential damage to the airline's reputation if not managed carefully.
The core of our analysis focuses on:\
● Quantifying the Benefits of Overbooking: By carefully modeling demand, pricing strategies, and passenger show-up probabilities, we aim to quantify the potential increase in revenue through overbooking.\
● Understanding the Risks and Costs: Identifying the direct costs associated with overbookings, such as compensations for bumped passengers, and indirect costs like potential harm to customer satisfaction and brand reputation.\
● Finding the Optimal Overbooking Limit: Through dynamic programming and simulation models, we explore various overbooking limits to identify the policy that maximizes expected discounted profits for the airline, considering both the financial benefits and associated risks.\
● Evaluating Overbooking Policies: We compare traditional overbooking strategies with a flexible approach that allows for day-to-day adjustments in ticket sales, providing insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.\

The effectiveness of an overbooking strategy is contingent upon accurately predicting passenger no-show rates and understanding the demand elasticity for different flight routes and times. Airline's approach to overbooking needs to be nuanced and data-driven, leveraging historical data and advanced analytics to inform policy decisions.
